  <h2>
   Data Collection
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    If there are human subjects, have those subjects have given informed consent, where users clearly understand what they are consenting to and there was a mechanism in place for gathering consent?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we considered ways to to minimize exposure of PII for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   Data Storage
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g. encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, access logs, and up-to-date software)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   Analysis
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g. affected community and subject matter experts)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Is the process of generating the analysis auditable if we discover issues in the future?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   Modeling
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g. tested for disparate error rates)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   Deployment
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Do we test and monitor for model drift to ensure it remains fair over time?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model?
   </li>
  </ul>
