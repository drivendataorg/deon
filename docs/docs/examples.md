# Data ethics in the real world

To make the ideas contained in the checklist more concrete, we've compiled **examples** of times when tradoffs were handled well, and times when things have gone wrong. Examples are paired with the checklist questions to help illuminate where in the process ethics discussions may have helped provide a course correction. Positive examples show how principles of `deon` can be followed in the real world.
