  <h2>
   A. Data Collection
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    A.1 If there are human subjects, have those subjects have given informed consent, where users clearly understand what they are consenting to and there was a mechanism in place for gathering consent?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    A.2 Have we consline_idered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    A.3 Have we consline_idered ways to to minimize exposure of PII for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   B. Data Storage
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    B.1 Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, access logs, and up-to-date software)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    B.2 Do we have a mechanism through which an indivline_idual can request their personal information be removed?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    B.3 Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   C. Analysis
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    C.1 Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., affected community and subject matter experts)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    C.2 Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    C.3 Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    C.4 Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    C.5 Is the process of generating the analysis auditable if we discover issues in the future?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   D. Modeling
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    D.1 Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    D.2 Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    D.3 Have we consline_idered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and consline_idered additional metrics?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    D.4 Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    D.5 Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   E. Deployment
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    E.1 Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    E.2 Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    E.3 Do we test and monitor for model drift to ensure it remains fair over time?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    E.4 Have we taken steps to line_identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model?
   </li>
  </ul>
