   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     A.2 Collection bias:

   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     A.3 Limit PII exposure:
    </strong>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     B.1 Data security:
    </strong>
    Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     B.2 Right to be forgotten:

   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     B.3 Data retention plan:
    </strong>
    Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?

  <h2>
   C. Analysis
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     C.1 Missing perspectives:
    </strong>
    Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     C.2 Dataset bias:
    </strong>
    Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     C.3 Honest representation:
    </strong>
    Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     C.4 Privacy in analysis:
    </strong>
    Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     C.5 Auditability:
    </strong>
    Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   D. Modeling
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     D.1 Proxy discrimination:
    </strong>
    Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     D.2 Fairness across groups:
    </strong>
    Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     D.3 Metric selection:
    </strong>
    Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     D.4 Explainability:
    </strong>
    Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     D.5 Communicate bias:
    </strong>
    Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h2>
   E. Deployment
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     E.1 Redress:
    </strong>
    Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     E.2 Roll back:
    </strong>
    Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     E.3 Concept drift:
    </strong>
    Do we test and monitor for concept drift to ensure the model remains fair over time?
   </li>
   <li>
    <input type="checkbox"/>
    <strong>
     E.4 Unintended use:
    </strong>
    Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?
